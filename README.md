# Just Die
> Just a die roller library written in ES6 ES2015, use for whatever obscure purpose.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save justdie
```

To use directly in the browser:

```html
<script src="path/to/yourCopyOf/justdie.js"></script>
```

or the minified version:

## Build
On install a Node compliant `index.js` will be created automatically:
